# == Adding your own datetime formats to to_formatted_s
# DateTime formats are shared with Time. You can add your own to the
# Time::DATE_FORMATS hash. Use the format name as the hash key and
# either a strftime string or Proc instance that takes a time or
# datetime argument as the value.
Time::DATE_FORMATS[:pretty] = lambda { |time| time.strftime('%a, %m/%d/%Y') + " AT " + time.strftime('%HH%M') }
